This is my Robot Smart Home Controller project
----------------------------------------------

I am building a custom Smart Home controller that will be
	a robot. The robot will have many sensors for checking
	conditions in the environment. This will include temperature
	and humidity sensors, various gas sensors, VOC (volatile
	organic compounds, alcohols, etc. There will be multiple
	sensors of each type to allow checking readings and using
	various sensor fusion algorithms.

Other sensors that will	be included are various distance sensors
  including ToF and ultrasonic sensors. I will also have a
  precision RTC (real-time clock for steady timekeeping.
